Hi Mayank - few doubts  yesterday i couldn't ask due to poor network. Please clearify 

1) Is databricks provide only software solution over any clound infra eg: AWS, GCP ?

2) Suppose We have already devloped a pipeline on AWS using AWS Glue or AWS Sagemaker. Now if we want to change using databricks So do we need to change/optimise in code as well or plateform will optimise the it self backend things ? 

- Connecting to S3 

3) Is Snowflake is similar databricks or any diffrence ?

4) Please do take a one session on Snowflake as well as well.


if we are good at sql snowflake would be easy to learn?


Mayank ,Any situation where hive edges compare  to spark or spark.sql.  &
Hive is part of the Hadoop ecosystem, originally designed to run on HDFS with MapReduce(abstraction).
Then Databricks does not use HDFS, but how it can still connect to Hive.
