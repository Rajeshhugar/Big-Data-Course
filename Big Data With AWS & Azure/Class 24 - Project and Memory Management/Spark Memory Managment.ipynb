Spark Memory Overview\n\nWhen a Spark application is launched, the Spark cluster starts two main processes:\n\n- **Driver**: The driver is responsible for creating the Spark context, submitting Spark jobs, and translating the Spark pipeline into computational units (tasks). It also coordinates task scheduling and orchestration on each executor.\n\n- **Executor**: Executors are worker nodes responsible for executing tasks and storing data. Each executor runs in its own JVM and has its own memory space.\n\n### Memory Components in Spark\n\nSpark memory is divided into several regions:\n\n- **Reserved Memory**: 300 MB reserved for system use.\n- **User Memory**: Memory used for user-defined data structures and RDD transformations.\n- **Storage Memory**: Memory used for caching RDDs and DataFrames.\n- **Execution Memory**: Memory used for temporary data during shuffles, joins, and aggregations.\n\nLet's visualize this:\n\n```\n+-----------------------------+\n|       Executor Memory       |\n+-----------------------------+\n| Reserved Memory (300 MB)    |\n+-----------------------------+\n| User Memory (40%)           |\n+-----------------------------+\n| Storage Memory (30%)        |\n+-----------------------------+\n| Execution Memory (30%)      |\n+-----------------------------+\n```\n\n### Memory Allocation in Executors\n\nEach executor's memory is divided into **Heap** and **Off-Heap** memory:\n\n- **Heap Memory**: Managed by the JVM, used for Spark operations and data storage.\n- **Off-Heap Memory**: Managed directly by Spark, not subject to JVM garbage collection.\n\nThe size of the executor heap memory is controlled by the `spark.executor.memory` configuration property."}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "## 2. Memory Allocation in Executors\n\nLet's break down the memory allocation in executors:\n\n### Heap Memory\n\nHeap memory is further divided into:\n\n- **Execution Memory**: Used for computation in shuffles, joins, sorts, and aggregations.\n- **Storage Memory**: Used for caching and propagating internal data across the cluster.\n\nThe size of the executor heap memory is controlled by the `spark.executor.memory` configuration property.\n\n### Off-Heap Memory\n\nOff-heap memory is used for storing data outside the JVM heap. This memory is not subject to Java's garbage collector and can be enabled using the `spark.memory.offHeap.enabled` configuration.\n\n### Overhead Memory\n\nOverhead memory is used for JVM overheads, interned strings, and other native overheads. By default, it is 10% of the executor memory with a minimum of 384 MB.\n\nLet's see how memory is allocated in an executor container:\n\n```\n+-----------------------------+\n|       Executor Container    |\n+-----------------------------+\n| Heap Memory (spark.executor.memory) |\n|   - Execution Memory (30%)  |\n|   - Storage Memory (30%)    |\n|   - User Memory (40%)       |\n+-----------------------------+\n| Off-Heap Memory (spark.memory.offHeap.size) |\n+-----------------------------+\n| Overhead Memory (10% of executor memory) |\n+-----------------------------+\n```"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "## 3. Dynamic Memory Management\n\nSpark uses a **dynamic memory management** mechanism to share memory between execution and storage. This mechanism allows execution memory to borrow memory from storage memory and vice versa.\n\n### How Dynamic Memory Management Works\n\n- **Execution Memory**: Used for temporary data during shuffles, joins, and aggregations.\n- **Storage Memory**: Used for caching RDDs and DataFrames.\n\nWhen execution memory is not fully utilized, storage memory can borrow from it. However, if execution memory needs more space, it can evict cached data from storage memory.\n\nLet's visualize this:\n\n```\n+-----------------------------+\n|       Shared Memory         |\n+-----------------------------+\n| Execution Memory            |\n|   - Can borrow from Storage |\n+-----------------------------+\n| Storage Memory              |\n|   - Can be evicted by Execution |\n+-----------------------------+\n```\n\n### Example Scenario\n\nLet's say we have an executor with 10 GB of memory allocated. The memory is divided as follows:\n\n- **Execution Memory**: 3 GB\n- **Storage Memory**: 3 GB\n- **User Memory**: 4 GB\n\nIf the execution memory is fully utilized, it can borrow memory from the storage memory. However, if the storage memory is also fully utilized, cached data may be evicted to free up space for execution memory."}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "## 4. Memory Tuning and Optimization\n\nTo optimize memory usage in Spark, you can tune the following configuration parameters:\n\n- **spark.executor.memory**: Controls the amount of memory allocated to each executor.\n- **spark.memory.fraction**: Controls the fraction of memory used for execution and storage.\n- **spark.memory.storageFraction**: Controls the fraction of memory reserved for storage.\n- **spark.memory.offHeap.enabled**: Enables or disables off-heap memory.\n- **spark.memory.offHeap.size**: Controls the size of off-heap memory.\n\n### Example: Tuning Memory for a Spark Application\n\nLet's say we have a Spark application that performs a lot of shuffles and joins. We can increase the execution memory to improve performance:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .appName(\"Memory Tuning Example\") \\\n    .config(\"spark.executor.memory\", \"10G\") \\\n    .config(\"spark.memory.fraction\", \"0.6\") \\\n    .config(\"spark.memory.storageFraction\", \"0.5\") \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n```\n\nIn this example, we allocate 10 GB of memory to each executor and set the memory fraction to 60%, with 50% of that memory reserved for storage."}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "## Conclusion\n\nIn this notebook, we explored the memory management in Apache Spark.
